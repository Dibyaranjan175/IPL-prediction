🏏 IPL Match Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the outcome of IPL matches based on historical data. The model analyzes various factors such as batting team, bowling team, venue, current score, overs, wickets, and run rate to estimate the probability of winning.

📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model capable of forecasting the winning probability of an IPL team during a match.
It uses:

Python

Pandas for data preprocessing

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-Learn for ML modeling (Logistic Regression or Random Forest)

The dataset contains ball-by-ball and match-level information of IPL seasons.
